I’m an Associate Scientist at the University of Wisconsin–Madison with over a decade of experience in Human Factors research, particularly in traffic safety. I’ve led projects for the U.S. Department of Transportation and industry clients, managing and investigating various aspects of Human Factors. Prior to my current role, I was a postdoctoral associate at MIT (2014–2016) and a Principal Research Scientist at Battelle Memorial Institute (2016–2020).

My research focuses on driving safety, with particular interest in driver–automation collaboration, designing effective human–machine interfaces, and applying advanced statistical methods to study driver interaction with manual and partially automated vehicles. I am currently exploring how AI can enhance the interaction between drivers and vehicles, including developing a RAG-based owner’s manual to contextualize driver education on automated driving features.
